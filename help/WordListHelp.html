<h1>WordMan Word Lists</h1>
<p>WordMan contains several built-in word lists, which are described below. The 
default word list, ENABLE, is suggested for general use, but other word lists 
have their uses too. Additional word lists can be easily added to WordMan. 
Simply create a text file with all of the word in it, one per line. Name the 
file <b><i>word-list</i>.words.txt</b> and place it in the WordMan program 
directory. You must restart WordMan after adding or changing a word list. Although using all
    the word lists may seem attractive at first, in practice the "ENABLE" and "Common
    Words" lists are most useful and yield the least amount of "junk" to sift through.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the word lists supplied with WordMan.</p>
<h2>ENABLE</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.puzzlers.org/wordlists/enable_readme.php">ENABLE 
(Enhanced North American Benchmark LExicon)</a> word list is a comprehensive, 
thoroughly checked, public domain word list for use with word games and puzzles. 
I used the ENABLE2K word list with supplements as follows:</p>
<p>signature words: YES<br>
new MW10 words: YES<br>
stale OSPD words: YES<br>
additional OSPD words: YES<br>
words confirmed by 2 dictionaries: YES<br>
additional plurals: YES<br>
OSW and Chambers words: NO<br>
lowercase acronyms: YES<br>
words with no part of speech: NO<br>
inflections of one letter words: NO<br>
upper-case words: YES<br>
case distinctions: NO<br>
uppercase acronyms: NO<br>
remove offensive words: NO<br>
remove words not valid in Scrabble: NO<br>
no word length limit</p>
<p>The primary deficiency of ENABLE for our purposes is that it designed for 
SCRABBLE use (and other word games), and hence does not have capitalized words 
or proper names. The &quot;upper-case&quot; words in the supplement that were included 
helps, but still many proper names are missing. To partially rectify that, I 
added some additional common proper names:</p>
<p>continents<br>
countries<br>
states<br>
planets<br>
a very few additional common capitalized words</p>
the one letter words "A" and "I"
<h2>ENABLE rare words</h2>
<p>The OSD/Chambers words from the ENABLE2K supplement; i.e. the file ABLE.LST</p>
<h2>Common words</h2>
<p>The merging of 6of12.txt and 2of12inf.txt from the
<a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/12dicts-readme.html">12dicts word lists</a>. 
Unlike ENABLE, this list also 
contains some common acronyms, hyphenated words, and two-word phrases. 
I removed all words 3 or less letters not present in ENABLE, as these were
acronyms, state abbreviations, and similar.</p>
<h2>UK advanced cryptics</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.puzzlers.org/wordlists/ukacd_readme.php">UK Advanced 
Cryptics dictionary</a> by Ross Bereford.</p>
<h2>Webster's New International</h2>
<p>Contents of Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed. An unabridged 
dictionary.</p>
<h2>Kitchen Sink</h2>
<p>A combined word list with many many words, including some rather dubious 
entries. A moderately useful last resort, but be aware that some entries are misspelled or
otherwise completely bogus. Use with caution.</p>
<h2>Places</h2>
<p>A list of places from
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/">MOBY words</a>, 
combined with a &quot;places&quot; list from the U.S. Census, and a list of all countries in the world. </p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>A list of names from <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/">
MOBY words</a>.</p>
<h2>Idioms</h2>
<p>A list of multi-word idioms and common phrases.</p>
<h2>NYT Crosswords</h2>
<p>A list of "words" that have appeared in New York Times crossword puzzle grids. Although many regular words are included, this also includes a lot of two or more word phrases, 
abbreviations, roman numerals, and other strange things that crossword designers like to put into their puzzles. Use for special purposes only. </p>
